# Resume Optimization Quick Reference Guide

## üö® ZERO TOLERANCE ISSUES (Must Be 100% Correct)

### 1. Spelling Errors in Headers
- ‚ùå "PROFESSINAL SUMMARY"
- ‚úÖ "PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY"
- **AI Check**: Run spell check on all headers first

### 2. Location Data Consistency
- ‚ùå "Virginia, Washington 30022" (different states!)
- ‚ùå "Virginia 30022" (30022 is Georgia zip code)
- ‚úÖ "Greater Atlanta Area"
- ‚úÖ "Alpharetta, GA"
- **AI Check**: Verify city/state/zip match

### 3. Date Format Consistency
- ‚ùå Mixing "2022 - Current" with "Expected December 2026"
- ‚úÖ "January 2022 - Present" AND "Expected December 2026"
- ‚úÖ "2022 - Present" AND "Expected 2026"
- **AI Check**: Pick ONE format, use everywhere

### 4. Remove Full Addresses
- ‚ùå "123 Main Street, Atlanta, GA 30022"
- ‚úÖ "Greater Atlanta Area"
- **Reason**: Privacy + bias concerns

## üö´ Eliminate This Section: "Key Qualifications"

**Problem**: Usually just repeats what's in Professional Experience

**Solution**: Replace with **CORE COMPETENCIES**

**Format**:
```
CORE COMPETENCIES
Help Desk Support | Azure Administration | Microsoft 365 Management
ServiceNow ITSM | Active Directory | Remote Desktop Support
VPN Configuration | ITIL Framework | SLA Management
```

---

## üíº STAR Method for Every Bullet

**Weak**:
```
‚Ä¢ Manage Microsoft 365 accounts and resolve user issues
```

**Strong (STAR)**:
```
‚Ä¢ Administered Microsoft 365 for 6,000+ users across 50+ locations, managing 
  account provisioning, license optimization, and permissions, achieving 95% 
  first-call resolution rate and 30% improvement in user satisfaction scores
```

**What Was Added**:
- **S**ituation: "6,000+ users across 50+ locations"
- **T**ask: "account provisioning, license optimization, permissions"
- **A**ction: "Administered Microsoft 365, managing..."
- **R**esult: "95% first-call resolution, 30% improvement"

---

## üìä Required Metrics (90%+ of bullets)

| **Dollar Amounts** | "$50K savings", "$2M budget managed" |

**Avoid**:

---
