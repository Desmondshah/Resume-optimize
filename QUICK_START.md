## Alternative: Upload Text Files

If your resume is already in `.txt` format, you can use the upload button.

**Note:** PDF upload requires complex browser setup and may not work reliably. The copy-paste method is much more reliable!

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to extract text from PDF"
**Solution:** Use the copy-paste method instead (see above) âœ…

### Text looks garbled
**Solution:** Make sure you're copying from the PDF viewer, not the source code
