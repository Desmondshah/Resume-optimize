## ATS-Friendly Resume Guidelines

### What ATS Systems Can't Handle
- ‚ùå Tables and columns
- ‚ùå Text boxes
- ‚ùå Headers and footers
- ‚ùå Images and graphics
- ‚ùå Special characters and symbols
- ‚ùå Unusual fonts

### What Works Best

- ‚úÖ Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- ‚úÖ Bullet points using standard characters (-, *)
- ‚úÖ Clear section separation
- ‚úÖ .docx or .pdf file format
- ‚úÖ Relevant keywords from job description

## Keyword Optimization Tips

### Finding the Right Keywords

1. **Scan the Job Description**
   - Look for repeated terms
   - Note specific skills mentioned
   - Identify industry jargon

2. **Check the Qualifications**
   - Required vs. preferred skills
   - Years of experience needed
   - Specific tools or technologies

3. **Review Our Extracted Keywords**
   - We automatically find the top 30 terms
   - Prioritize the most relevant ones
   - Use them naturally in your experience

### Using Keywords Effectively

**Bad Example:**
"Managed projects. Skilled in Python, Java, React, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes..."

**Good Example:**
"Led 5-person development team using Agile methodologies to deliver Python-based web applications with React frontend and AWS infrastructure, reducing deployment time by 40% through Docker containerization."

## File Format Recommendations

### For Upload
- **TXT**: Always works, best for initial uploads
- **PDF**: Requires PDF parsing (currently basic support)
- **DOCX**: Requires Word document parsing (currently basic support)

### For Final Resume
- **DOCX**: Most compatible with ATS systems
- **PDF**: Good for human review, variable ATS compatibility
- **TXT**: Not recommended for applications, good for optimization
