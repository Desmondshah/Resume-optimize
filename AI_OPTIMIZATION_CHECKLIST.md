# AI Resume Optimization Checklist

## Pre-Processing Checks (ALWAYS RUN FIRST)

### 1. Spell Check Headers
```
□ Run spell check on ALL section headers
□ Common errors to catch:
  - "PROFESSINAL" → "PROFESSIONAL"
  - "EXPERIANCE" → "EXPERIENCE"
  - "EDUCATON" → "EDUCATION"
  - "CERTFICATIONS" → "CERTIFICATIONS"
```

### 2. Location Validation
```
□ Check city/state match
□ Verify zip code matches city/state
□ Remove full street addresses
□ Use metro area format (e.g., "Greater Atlanta Area")

Common errors:
❌ "Virginia, Washington 30022" (different states + wrong zip)
❌ "New York, NY 90210" (90210 is Beverly Hills, CA)
✅ "Greater Boston Area"
✅ "San Francisco, CA"
```

### 3. Date Format Standardization
```
□ Choose ONE format and apply everywhere
□ Check consistency between:
  - Work experience dates
  - Education dates
  - Project dates
  - Certification dates

Options:
✅ "January 2022 - Present" (recommended)
✅ "2022 - Present" (acceptable)

Avoid mixing:
❌ "2022 - Current" AND "Expected December 2026"
```

### 4. Contact Information
```
□ Full name present
□ Phone number (formatted consistently)
□ Email address (professional)
□ LinkedIn URL (if available)
□ NO full street address
□ Location = metro area or city, state only
```

## Content Optimization

### Professional Summary (MANDATORY)
```
□ Length: 2-4 sentences (NOT 5+)
□ Includes: [Years] + [Job Title]
□ Includes: Key technologies/platforms
□ Includes: Scale/scope (e.g., "6,000+ users")
□ Includes: 1-2 quantified achievements
□ Uses active voice
□ No generic filler phrases

Template:
[Job Title] with [X]+ years [doing what] in [environment]. 
Proven expertise in [key skills]. [Achievement 1] while 
[achievement 2] through [method].
```

### Core Competencies Section (MANDATORY)
```
□ Section titled "CORE COMPETENCIES" (not "Key Qualifications")
□ Keyword-rich (12-18 keywords)
□ Includes role-specific technical skills
□ Includes tools/platforms from job description
□ Includes relevant soft skills
□ Format: "Skill 1 | Skill 2 | Skill 3" or bullets
□ NO redundant descriptions (just keywords)

Example format:
CORE COMPETENCIES
Skill 1 | Skill 2 | Skill 3 | Skill 4
Skill 5 | Skill 6 | Skill 7 | Skill 8
```

### Professional Experience (STAR Method)
```
For EACH bullet point:

□ Starts with strong action verb (not "Responsible for...")
□ Includes SITUATION/TASK context with numbers
□ Specifies tools/platforms/methods used
□ Has quantified RESULT (metric)
□ Is 1-2 lines maximum (not a paragraph)

Required metrics (at least ONE per bullet):
□ Percentage (30% improvement)
□ Dollar amount ($50K savings)
□ Time (reduced from 45 to 28 minutes)
□ Volume/scale (6,000+ users)
□ Rating (4.8/5 satisfaction)
□ Before/after comparison

Target: 90%+ of bullets have metrics
```

### Action Verbs Checklist
```
Avoid weak verbs:
❌ Responsible for
❌ Worked on
❌ Helped with
❌ Assisted in
❌ Managed (overused)

Use strong verbs:
✅ Administered, Architected, Spearheaded
✅ Optimized, Streamlined, Enhanced
✅ Implemented, Deployed, Configured
✅ Achieved, Improved, Increased, Reduced
✅ Coordinated, Directed, Led
```

```

### Keyword Integration
```
□ Professional Summary: Top 3-5 keywords

## Common Mistakes - Auto-Fix

### Weak Patterns to Strengthen
```
❌ "Responsible for managing..."
✅ "Managed X users/systems achieving Y% improvement"

❌ "Worked on improving customer satisfaction"
✅ "Improved satisfaction from 3.2 to 4.8/5.0 (50% increase)"

❌ "Helped develop knowledge base"
✅ "Developed 50+ knowledge base articles, reducing tickets 40%"

❌ "Experience with Microsoft 365"
✅ "Administered Microsoft 365 for 6,000+ users across 50+ locations"
```

### Redundancy Removal
```
❌ Key Qualifications section that repeats Experience
✅ Core Competencies section with keywords only

❌ Multiple bullet points saying same thing
✅ Combine into one stronger bullet

❌ Generic skill lists (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
✅ Relevant technical skills only
```

---

## Quantification Targets

### Minimum Metrics Required
```
□ 90%+ of bullets have at least ONE metric

Types of metrics:
□ Percentage improvement/reduction
□ Dollar amounts saved/managed
□ Time savings (before/after)
□ Volume/scale (users, locations, tickets)
□ Ratings/scores (satisfaction, compliance)
□ Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
```

### Metric Enhancement Examples
```
"Managed user accounts"
→ "Managed 6,000+ user accounts across 50+ locations"

"Improved response time"
→ "Improved response time from 45 to 28 minutes (38% faster)"

"Reduced support tickets"
→ "Reduced support tickets by 40% (from 200 to 120 monthly)"
```

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Target Metrics
```
□ ATS Passage Rate: 95%+
□ Interview Callback Rate: 15-20% (1 in 5-7 applications)
□ Keyword Match Score: 70-85%
□ Quantification Rate: 90%+ bullets
□ STAR Method Rate: 80%+ bullets
```

### Quality Score
```
7/10 = Basic resume (needs work)
8/10 = Good resume (ATS-friendly)
9/10 = Excellent resume (optimized)
10/10 = Perfect resume (rare, top 5%)

Target: 9/10 minimum
```
