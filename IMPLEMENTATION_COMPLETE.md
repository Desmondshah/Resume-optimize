## 🎓 Key Features Implemented

### 1. ⚠️ Zero Tolerance Quality Control
The AI now automatically detects and fixes:

| Issue | Example | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **Spelling in headers** | "PROFESSINAL SUMMARY" | "PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY" |
| **Location errors** | "Virginia, Washington 30022" | "Greater Atlanta Area" |
| **Date inconsistency** | "2022 - Current" + "Dec 2026" | "January 2022 - Present" |
| **Full addresses** | "123 Main St, City, ST" | "Greater City Area" |

### 2. 📝 Content Standards Enforced

| Standard | Rule | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Professional Summary** | 2-4 sentences only | "IT Specialist with 3+ years managing Microsoft 365 for 6,000+ users. Increased satisfaction 30% while reducing resolution time 25%." |
| **Core Competencies** | Keyword-rich section | "Azure AD \| Microsoft 365 \| ServiceNow \| ITIL" |
| **Bullet Metrics** | 90%+ must be quantified | "Managed 6,000+ users achieving 95% FCR" |
| **STAR Method** | All bullets need context + result | "Administered [tool] for [scale], achieving [metric]" |

### 3. 🎯 Keyword Optimization

| Aspect | Target | How It Works |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Match Rate** | 70-85% | Extract keywords from job desc → integrate naturally |
| **Priority Areas** | Summary → Competencies → Experience | Higher ATS weight at top |
| **Role-Specific** | Different per job type | IT Support ≠ Developer ≠ PM keywords |
| **Natural Integration** | No keyword stuffing | Keywords in context with achievements |

### 4. 📊 STAR Method Framework

Every bullet now includes:

```
Situation/Task (Context)
↓
Action (What you did)
↓
Result (Quantified outcome)
```

**Before (Weak)**:
> Managed Microsoft 365 accounts

**After (STAR)**:
> Administered Microsoft 365 for 6,000+ users across 50+ locations, managing account provisioning, license optimization, and permissions, achieving 95% first-call resolution rate and 30% improvement in user satisfaction scores

### 5. 📈 Quantification Requirements

Target: **90%+ of bullets** must have metrics

| Metric Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Percentages** | "30% improvement", "40% reduction" |
| **Dollar Amounts** | "$50K savings", "$2M budget managed" |
| **Time Savings** | "Reduced from 45 to 28 minutes" |
| **Volume/Scale** | "6,000+ users", "200+ tickets/month" |
| **Ratings** | "4.8/5 satisfaction", "98% SLA compliance" |
| **Before/After** | "Improved from 70% to 95%" |
