## 🔑 REQUIRED: Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

**Before you can use the optimizer, you MUST add your OpenAI API key to Convex:**

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in (or create an account)
3. Click **"Create new secret key"**
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable in Convex

**Run this command in PowerShell** (replace with your actual key):

```powershell
npx convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY sk-proj-your-actual-key-here
```

When prompted, type `y` and press Enter to confirm.

### Step 3: Verify It Worked

Check that it's set:
```powershell
npx convex env list
```

You should see `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the list (value will be hidden).

### Step 4: Test It!

The backend reloads automatically. Just try optimizing a resume - it should work now!
